🎬 RAG Assistant – Netflix Movies Q&A

A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers questions about Netflix movies using semantic search and local LLM inference.

Built to demonstrate: Embeddings,  Vector databases,  LangChain LCEL pipelines, Local LLM integration,  REST API deployment


🚀 What This Project Does

This project implements a fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built on Netflix movie data.

It ingests 6,020 movie records and splits them into 7,655 semantically meaningful chunks to improve retrieval precision. Each chunk is converted into dense vector embeddings using the lightweight all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model and stored in a persistent Chroma vector database for efficient semantic search.

When a user submits a question, the system retrieves the most relevant movie contexts using similarity search and passes them to a local TinyLlama language model to generate grounded, context-aware answers.

The entire pipeline is exposed through a Flask REST API, making it production-ready and easy to integrate into other applications.

Everything runs locally on CPU — no external API calls, subscriptions, or usage costs required.

⚙️ SETUP:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/K-Ksaveras/rag-assistant.git
cd rag-assistant

Virtual Environment:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

🧩 Key Engineering Decisions

Chunk size 500 + overlap 50 → balances recall & precision

Persistent Chroma store → avoids re-embedding

LCEL pipeline syntax → modern LangChain design

Local LLM → zero API cost & privacy-safe

Separation of concerns → notebook for data, Python modules for production



🔄 Where This Architecture Can Be Reused

The same RAG system structure can be adapted for:

🏦 Internal Knowledge Assistants
Answering questions over HR policies, compliance documents, or internal banking procedures.

📚 Educational Q&A Systems
Retrieval-based tutoring systems grounded in textbooks or course materials.

🏢 Company Documentation Search
Semantic search over technical docs, onboarding guides, or support manuals.

🛍 E-Commerce Product Assistants
Answering product questions using structured catalog data.

⚖️ Legal / Regulatory Search
Querying contracts, policies, or regulatory documents with contextual grounding.

🧾 Customer Support Automation
Combining retrieval with LLM generation to provide accurate, source-backed answers
